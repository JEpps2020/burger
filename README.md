# burger
In this assignment, I have created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I have followed the the MVC design pattern-using Node and MySQL to query and route data my data into my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML. 

Users are able to input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name into the input field, my app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page, appearing as grayed out. My app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
